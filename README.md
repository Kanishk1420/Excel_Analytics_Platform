# Excel Analytics Platform

Last Updated: May 11, 2025

## Today's Updates

Today we implemented a new Excel file upload and parsing functionality within the dashboard. The updates include:

- Added an advanced dashboard UI with a modern sidebar layout and responsive design
- Implemented Excel/CSV file upload with drag-and-drop functionality
- Created backend integration using GridFS for handling large files (beyond MongoDB's 16MB limit)
- Added preview functionality for uploaded Excel data

## Week 2 Progress

This week we've made significant additions to the platform:

### Authentication & Security
- Implemented complete authentication flow (login, signup, logout)
- Added password reset functionality with email integration
- Created JWT-based authentication for secure API access
- Implemented role-based access control (admin vs user)
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend
- Added responsive notifications for user actions

### UI/UX Improvements
- Created engaging intro animation sequence with GSAP
- Designed responsive layouts for mobile and tablet devices
- Added custom form components (checkbox, input fields with toggle visibility)
- Implemented drag-and-drop file upload with validation and progress tracking
- Created admin-specific dashboard sections with role-based UI

### Backend Enhancements
- Integrated SendGrid for email communications (password reset)
- Improved Excel file handling with GridFS for large files
- Added secure file upload validation and processing
- Enhanced error handling across all API endpoints
- Implemented secure password handling with bcrypt

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Created a new `FileUpload` component with drag-and-drop interface
- Enhanced the Dashboard UI with modern sidebar navigation
- Added responsive styling for mobile compatibility
- Implemented file validation and preview capabilities
- Added Redux state management for authentication
- Created custom notification system for user feedback
- Implemented password reset flow with secure token

### Backend Changes
- Set up GridFS for storing large Excel files
- Created API endpoints for file upload, download and retrieval
- Implemented Excel parsing using the XLSX library
- Added JWT authentication for secure file operations
- Created password reset token generation and validation
- Integrated email service for communication

## Environment Setup

### Setting Up .env File
1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory
2. Add the following environment variables:

```
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myauthdb

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_very_long_and_secure_secret_key

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_email@example.com

# Frontend URL (for password reset links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

3. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials
4. Generate a secure JWT secret using:
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

### SendGrid Account Setup
1. **Create a SendGrid Account**:
   - Go to [SendGrid's website](https://sendgrid.com/) and sign up for a free account
   - Verify your account through the confirmation email

2. **Verify a Sender Identity**:
   - Navigate to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Choose either "Single Sender Verification" or "Domain Authentication"
   - For testing, use Single Sender Verification by adding your email address
   - Complete the verification process by clicking the link sent to your email

3. **Create an API Key**:
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name your key (e.g., "Excel Analytics Platform")
   - Select "Full Access" or "Restricted Access" with at least "Mail Send" permissions
   - Copy the generated API key immediately (it won't be shown again)

4. **Add API Key to .env File**:
   - Paste your API key as the value for `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your .env file
   - Set `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` to your verified email address

### MongoDB Setup
1. **Local Development**:
   - Install MongoDB on your machine or use MongoDB Atlas
   - Create a database named 'myauthdb' (or choose your own name)
   - Update the MONGO_URI in .env with your connection string

2. **Production**:
   - Use MongoDB Atlas or other cloud database service
   - Update the MONGO_URI with your production connection string
   - Set NODE_ENV=production in your environment variables

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Select the "File Upload" tab
3. Drag and drop or browse for an Excel/CSV file
4. Click "Upload & Process Data"
5. View the parsed data preview

## Authentication Flow
1. Users can register with username, email, and password
2. Login with email and password
3. Reset password via email if forgotten
4. Role-based access to features (admin vs regular users)

## Known Issues
- Files larger than 100MB should be handled with care to avoid Git repository issues
- Email service requires proper SendGrid API key configuration in production

## Next Steps
- Improving Dashboard and Website UI/UX
- Implement data visualization for uploaded Excel files
- Add batch processing capabilities for multiple files
- Create user permissions for file access control
- Add analytics dashboard with charts and graphs
