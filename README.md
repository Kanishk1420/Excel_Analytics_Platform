# Excel Analytics Platform

Last Updated: May 21, 2025

## Week 3 Progress

During Week 3, we focused on improving file handling, fixing critical bugs, and enhancing the user experience:

### Backend Improvements
- Fixed critical ObjectId constructor error in excelRoutes.js by properly using `new` keyword when creating MongoDB ObjectId instances
- Improved error handling for file deletion and download operations
- Enhanced GridFS integration for better file storage operations
- Added more robust token verification for file operations

### File Analysis Enhancements
- Implemented automatic file selection in analysis view for newly uploaded files
- Added persistent file selection using localStorage to maintain state between sessions
- Improved file metadata display with better formatting
- Created unified handling of both CSV and Excel files with appropriate icons

### User Interface Improvements
- Added distinctive styling for CSV files with orange icon to differentiate from Excel files (green)
- Enhanced dropdown menu functionality in the AnalyzeData component
- Added better empty state handling when no files are available
- Improved responsive design for file analysis on various screen sizes
- Added "No selection" messaging when files exist but none selected

### User Experience Flow
- Created seamless transition between file upload and analysis by:
  - Auto-saving the most recently uploaded file ID to localStorage
  - Automatically selecting this file when navigating to analysis view
  - Adding a direct "Analyze Files" button after successful upload
- Fixed console error messages for better debugging

### Styling Improvements
- Enhanced image responsiveness across all device sizes
- Improved container sizing for better display on larger screens
- Added responsive adjustments for 2K+ displays
- Fixed image scaling on mobile and smaller screens

## Next Steps for Week 4
- Implement data visualization for the selected files
- Add data filtering capabilities
- Create data export functionality
- Add user file management (rename, delete, organize)
- Implement collaborative features for team analysis

## Technical Details

The key bug fix implemented was addressing the MongoDB ObjectId constructor issue:

```javascript
// Previous code with error
await bucket.delete(mongoose.Types.ObjectId(existingFile.fileId));

// Fixed code
await bucket.delete(new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(existingFile.fileId));
```

The file selection persistence was implemented using localStorage:

```javascript
// Save file selection to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('selectedFileId', file._id);

// Retrieve and use saved selection on component load
const savedFileId = localStorage.getItem('selectedFileId');
if (savedFileId && response.data.length > 0) {
  const savedFile = response.data.find(file => file._id === savedFileId);
  if (savedFile) {
    setSelectedFile(savedFile);
  }
}
```

## Image Slider Implementation

### Login Page Enhancement
- Replaced static login image with an interactive image slider to improve user engagement
- Added the ability to showcase multiple images with automatic rotation
- Implemented indicator dots for manual navigation between slides

### Technical Details
- Created a new reusable `ImageSlider` component for displaying rotating images
- Added responsive styles to ensure proper display across all device sizes
- Integrated smooth transition effects between images
- Ensured proper scaling on mobile devices and large screens

### CSS Enhancements
- Added slider-specific styles in responsive.css:
  ```css
  .image-slider {
    position: relative;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .slider-indicators {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 20px;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 10px;
    z-index: 10;
  }
  ```

- Updated the Login component to utilize the new ImageSlider:
  ```javascript
  <div className="login-left-flex">
    <ImageSlider />
  </div>
  ```

### User Experience Benefits
- Provides a more visually appealing login experience
- Allows showcasing product features and benefits through rotating images
- Maintains responsive design across all device sizes from mobile to large desktop screens
