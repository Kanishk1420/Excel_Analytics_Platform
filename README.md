## Week 3 Progress

This week we've enhanced the platform with several improvements:

### Excel File Handling Enhancements
- Improved multiple file upload capabilities with simultaneous file processing
- Added advanced file validation and more detailed error handling
- Enhanced the upload progress tracking with per-file progress indicators
- Implemented partial upload success handling for batch file uploads
- Added better metadata extraction from Excel files (headers, row count)

### User Interface Improvements
- Redesigned file upload component with drag-and-drop area and file list
- Added animated notifications for upload status (success, partial, error)
- Enhanced responsive design for dashboard components on all device sizes
- Added subtle animations for better user feedback during interactions
- Improved user dropdown menu in dashboard header with new options

### Backend Optimizations
- Optimized GridFS integration for better performance with large files
- Enhanced JWT authentication with more robust token verification
- Improved error handling in file upload routes for better diagnostics
- Added temporary file cleanup to prevent storage issues
- Implemented better file type detection for Excel and CSV formats

### Security Enhancements
- Strengthened authentication flow with better token validation
- Added more secure password reset functionality
- Improved user data protection and validation
- Enhanced error reporting without exposing sensitive information
- Better environment variable handling for sensitive configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Created a new `FileUpload` component with drag-and-drop interface
- Enhanced the Dashboard UI with modern sidebar navigation
- Added responsive styling for mobile compatibility
- Implemented file validation and preview capabilities
- Added Redux state management for authentication
- Created custom notification system for user feedback
- Implemented password reset flow with secure token

### Backend Changes
- Set up GridFS for storing large Excel files
- Created API endpoints for file upload, download and retrieval
- Implemented Excel parsing using the XLSX library
- Added JWT authentication for secure file operations
- Created password reset token generation and validation
- Integrated email service for communication

## Environment Setup

### Setting Up .env File
1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory
2. Add the following environment variables:

```
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myauthdb

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_very_long_and_secure_secret_key

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_email@example.com

# Frontend URL (for password reset links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

3. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials
4. Generate a secure JWT secret using:
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

### SendGrid Account Setup
1. **Create a SendGrid Account**:
   - Go to [SendGrid's website](https://sendgrid.com/) and sign up for a free account
   - Verify your account through the confirmation email

2. **Verify a Sender Identity**:
   - Navigate to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Choose either "Single Sender Verification" or "Domain Authentication"
   - For testing, use Single Sender Verification by adding your email address
   - Complete the verification process by clicking the link sent to your email

3. **Create an API Key**:
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name your key (e.g., "Excel Analytics Platform")
   - Select "Full Access" or "Restricted Access" with at least "Mail Send" permissions
   - Copy the generated API key immediately (it won't be shown again)

4. **Add API Key to .env File**:
   - Paste your API key as the value for `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your .env file
   - Set `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` to your verified email address

### MongoDB Setup
1. **Local Development**:
   - Install MongoDB on your machine or use MongoDB Atlas
   - Create a database named 'myauthdb' (or choose your own name)
   - Update the MONGO_URI in .env with your connection string

2. **Production**:
   - Use MongoDB Atlas or other cloud database service
   - Update the MONGO_URI with your production connection string
   - Set NODE_ENV=production in your environment variables

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Select the "File Upload" tab
3. Drag and drop or browse for an Excel/CSV file
4. Click "Upload & Process Data"
5. View the parsed data preview

## Authentication Flow
1. Users can register with username, email, and password
2. Login with email and password
3. Reset password via email if forgotten
4. Role-based access to features (admin vs regular users)

## Known Issues
- Files larger than 100MB should be handled with care to avoid Git repository issues
- Email service requires proper SendGrid API key configuration in production

## Next Steps
- Improving Dashboard and Website UI/UX
- Implement data visualization for uploaded Excel files
- Add batch processing capabilities for multiple files
- Create user permissions for file access control
- Add analytics dashboard with charts and graphs
