# Excel Analytics Platform

Last Updated: May 6, 2025

## Today's Updates

Today we implemented a new Excel file upload and parsing functionality within the dashboard. The updates include:

- Added an advanced dashboard UI with a modern sidebar layout and responsive design
- Implemented Excel/CSV file upload with drag-and-drop functionality
- Created backend integration using GridFS for handling large files (beyond MongoDB's 16MB limit)
- Added preview functionality for uploaded Excel data

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Created a new `FileUpload` component with drag-and-drop interface
- Enhanced the Dashboard UI with modern sidebar navigation
- Added responsive styling for mobile compatibility
- Implemented file validation and preview capabilities

### Backend Changes
- Set up GridFS for storing large Excel files
- Created API endpoints for file upload, download and retrieval
- Implemented Excel parsing using the XLSX library
- Added JWT authentication for secure file operations

## File Structure
The implementation follows the existing project structure:
```
backend/
  ├── models/
  │   └── ExcelFile.js (new)
  ├── routes/
  │   └── excelRoutes.js (new)
  └── temp-uploads/ (new directory for temporary file storage)

frontend/
  └── src/
      └── components/
          ├── Dashboard.js (updated)
          └── FileUpload.js (new)
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Select the "File Upload" tab
3. Drag and drop or browse for an Excel/CSV file
4. Click "Upload & Process Data"
5. View the parsed data preview

## Known Issues
- Files larger than 100MB should be handled with care to avoid Git repository issues

## Next Steps
- Improving Dashboard and Website Ui/Ux
- Implement data visualization for uploaded Excel files
- Add batch processing capabilities for multiple files
- Create user permissions for file access control
