Last Updated: June 11, 2025

## Week 4 Progress

During Week 4, we focused on refining the user interface, resolving styling conflicts, and enhancing user experience across the application:

### UI/UX Improvements
- Fixed button styling conflicts between global styles and component-specific styles
- Resolved issues with form button width by adding override classes to maintain consistent layout
- Enhanced the AI Insights component with proper button sizing and positioning
- Improved the visual consistency of interactive elements across the platform
- Added responsive design adjustments for better mobile experience

### Button Styling Enhancements
- Added specificity to override global button width settings without breaking login functionality
- Implemented utility classes (`button-auto-width` and `exclude-global-styles`) for selective style overrides
- Fixed the ask button width issue in AI Insights section to prevent full-width expansion
- Maintained proper border-radius on buttons in question input wrappers
- Enhanced hover and focus states across all interactive elements

### Icon Updates
- Changed message icon to a send/arrow icon ("â†’") in AI Insights module for better user experience
- Implemented an icon-specific class (`send-icon`) for consistent styling
- Enhanced visual feedback on button interactions with appropriate icon sizing and positioning
- Maintained proper spacing between icons and text in buttons

### CSS Architecture Improvements
- Implemented more specific CSS selectors to prevent style conflicts
- Added important flags for critical override styles where needed
- Fixed responsive layout issues with the question input wrapper
- Ensured mobile compatibility by maintaining horizontal alignment in form elements
- Created reusable style patterns for consistent button appearance

### Technical Optimizations
- Fixed potential style inheritance issues across nested components
- Ensured proper border-radius on input wrappers and buttons
- Optimized CSS selectors for better rendering performance
- Created CSS comments for better code maintainability
- Implemented responsive adjustments for varying screen sizes

### Next Steps
- Implement data filtering capabilities
- Create data export functionality for visualizations
- Add user file management features (rename, delete, organize)
- Enhance AI response displays with improved typography and layout
- Implement collaborative features for team analysis

## Technical Approach

To resolve the button width styling conflicts between global and component styles, we implemented the following solution:

```css
/* Added to component-specific CSS */
.ask-button {
  background-color: #2e7d32;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  height: 100%;
  min-width: 60px;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
  width: auto !important; /* Override the global width: 100% */
}

/* Added to global CSS for more selective targeting */
form button[type="submit"]:not(.exclude-global-styles), 
form button[type="button"]:not(.exclude-global-styles) {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 16px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 30px;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

/* Added utility class for width overrides */
.button-auto-width {
  width: auto !important;
  padding: 0 15px !important;
}
```

This approach allowed us to maintain the global styles for primary buttons while creating exceptions for specific components that required alternative styling, resulting in a more consistent user interface throughout the application.
